ASCII Art Converter

This is a simple command-line tool that converts images to ASCII art. It takes an input image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG, or BMP) and generates a corresponding ASCII art representation in a text file. The program converts each pixel of the image into an ASCII character based on its grayscale value, creating a visual representation of the image using text characters.

Key Features:
- Supports various image formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP
- Generates ASCII art representation of images
- Customizable ASCII character set for different gradations
- Option to specify the output text file for saving the ASCII art

Usage:
1. Run the program and select an input image file.
2. Choose the output text file for saving the ASCII art.
3. The program will convert the image to ASCII art and save it in the text file.
4. The ASCII art can be opened and viewed in any text editor.

This project is implemented in C++ using the Qt framework and can be a fun way to explore the creative possibilities of ASCII art. Feel free to customize the ASCII character set to create unique visual effects with different images.

Note: The project requires Qt and the Qt development libraries to be installed on your system.

Contributions, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome! Enjoy creating ASCII art from your favorite images.
